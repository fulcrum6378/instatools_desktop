# InstaTools

InstaTools is an application consisting of tools which help managing contents from Instagram.
It uses the Instagram Web API for:

1. Downloading bulk content from Instagram
2. Exporting direct messages in HTML, TXT and JSON file formats
3. Retrieving information about a user including their high-quality profile picture

### Modules

This project is written in pure Kotlin and contains 3 modules:

1. **CORE**: containing the core tools for interacting with the Instagram API.
2. **CLI**: an interactive command-line interface deployed as a JAR. 
   It requires you to manually extract Instagram cookies from your browser and put them in `cookies.txt`.
3. **JFX**: A JavaFX desktop application.

    - `p`|`posts`: posts of a profile
    - `t`|`tagged`: tagged posts of a profile
    - `r`|`story`: story of a profile
